<summary><h2>👨‍🚀My Coding Journey
</h2></summary>
I began my journey as an industrial engineering student, eager to delve into the world of data science. My internship at an NGO focused on data analysis and process improvement ignited my passion further. Excelling in my role, I secured a full-time position as a project engineer even before graduating. After spending nearly 5 years with the NGO, my mission was always to make a positive impact, even indirectly.

Following this, I dedicated 3 years to teaching high school math and physics, a profoundly enriching experience that honed my communication skills. Learning surpassed teaching; I realised the power of leading by example and simplifying complex concepts for easy understanding.

In 2022, I embarked on a journey around the world, immersing myself in diverse cultures and languages while exploring new skills and opportunities. During this time, I've been sharing my expertise as an online Spanish teacher, guiding individuals towards their goals.

In 2024, my aim is to continue sharing my knowledge and experiences with a broader audience. As a digital creator, I aspire to impart wisdom in various formats, enabling others to grow while embracing new challenges.

My journey reflects a tapestry of experiences that have deepened my global perspective and fueled my commitment to make a difference.
